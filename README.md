# IBM Python Project for Data Engineering (3 Projects)

## Role: Data Engineer

## Final Project: Acquiring and Processing Information on the World's Largest Banks

In this project, you will put all the skills acquired throughout the course and your knowledge of basic Python to test. You will work on real-world data and perform the operations of Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) as required.

*Project Scenario:*

You have been hired as a data engineer by research organization. Your boss has asked you to create a code that can be used to compile the list of the top 10 largest banks in the world ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. Further, the data needs to be transformed and stored in GBP, EUR and INR as well, in accordance with the exchange rate information that has been made available to you as a CSV file. The processed information table is to be saved locally in a CSV format and as a database table.
Your job is to create an automated system to generate this information so that the same can be executed in every financial quarter to prepare the report.

*Summary/Overview:*

Using Python and data engineering skills to extract, transform, and manage information on the top 10 largest banks globally. Beginning with logging function creation for tracking code progress, and applying web scraping to extract tabular data from a designated webpage. Then transform data, including currency conversion based on exchange rates, and load it into both CSV files and an SQLite database. Executing SQL queries on the database enables deeper insights into the processed data, facilitating key metric extraction such as average market capitalization and top bank names.

## Accessing Databases using Python Script

*Summary/Overview:*

In this project, starting into database management using Python, particularly focusing on SQLite. The process entails initializing a database named STAFF, loading data from a CSV file into a table named INSTRUCTOR, executing various SQL queries for data retrieval and manipulation, appending additional data to the table, and finally, closing the database connection. Through these steps, gaining practical experience in creating, populating, querying, and modifying databases, solidifying their proficiency in database management tasks. This project underscores Python's versatility in interacting with databases, offering valuable skills essential for data engineering roles.

## Web scraping and Extracting Data using APIs 
### (Webscraping The 100 Most Highly-Ranked Films)

*Summary/Overview:*

This project involves extracting information about the top 50 highly-ranked films from a web page and storing it in both CSV and SQLite formats using Python. Through web scraping, gathering data like Average Rank, Film Name, and Year from the webpage's HTML structure. Key steps include initializing libraries, loading the webpage, analyzing HTML code, scraping required information, and storing the data. By executing the Python script, automating the data extraction and storage process, showcasing the practical application of web scraping for data collection and management tasks.
